# Autonomous-Car-Object-detection
1). Car detection is the first and foremost work for building a autonomous car/ self driving cars
2). In the this project we are using the dataset of images captured and build by drive.ai.
3). The YOLO (you look only once) algorithm is used by us for detectiong the multiple object in an image efficiently.
4). Following are the prerequired knowledge and topics for building such system:
    a). Convolutional Neural Networks
    b). Non - max suppression
    c). Anchor box
    d). YOLO
5). Python and other deep learning plateforms (tensorflow , keras) are used to code for the same.
6). The above model can be trained on our own images by processing the image int onumpy array.
