#YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time.
#This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. 
#After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

    """Filters YOLO boxes by thresholding on object and class confidence.
    
    Arguments:
    box_confidence -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 1)
    boxes -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 4)
    box_class_probs -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 80)
    threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get rid of the corresponding box
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the class probability score for selected boxes
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), containing (b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w) coordinates of selected boxes
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the index of the class detected by the selected boxes
    
    Note: "None" is here because you don't know the exact number of selected boxes, as it depends on the threshold. 
    For example, the actual output size of scores would be (10,) if there are 10 boxes.
